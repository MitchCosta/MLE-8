Algorithm Understanding
Is SVM (Support Vector Machine) a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm?
Supervised learning algorithm, it has a label to learn from.

Why is SVM such a powerful classification method?
It’s efficient in high feature space and is memory efficient.

What are 3 disadvantages of SVMs?
Don’t work well big training data, running time is high.
Don’t work well with high number of features and low training samples.
Don’t perform well on data with high noise.

What is the time complexity of SVM?
It’s exponential on number of samples

What is it for Logistic Regression?
It’s linear on number of samples.

Explain feature importance for the Random Forest algorithm?
Feature importance is a measure of how a specific feature explains the target label. The bigger the value the more important that feature is to calculate the target variable.

When examining feature importance, what is Gini impurity or information gain?
In this context, Gini Impurity tells us what the probability is of misclassifying an observation.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model, what is it and how does it work?

SHAP is a method used to increase transparency and interpretability of machine learning models. It’s used  to explain how each feature affects the model output. It’s a visualization tool that can be used for making a machine learning model more explainable by visualizing its output.
Basically it measure the average marginal contribution of an instance of a feature among all possible coalitions to the output label.
